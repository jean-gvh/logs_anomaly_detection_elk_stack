# logs_anomaly_detection_elk_stack
This repository explains the implementation of a logs anomaly detection architecture using ElasticSearch and Kibana, as well as a machine learning model. The purpose of this architecture is to analyze anomalies and suspicious behavior in a cluster of machines in near real time.

Nota bene : This repository does not deals with the set up of the cluster of machines, but focus more on the development of the machine learning model and its usage in production. 

Therefore, the following explainations will be articulated in 3 main points : 
* Code structure and workflow behaviour.
* Justification of the choosen machine learning model.
* Relevancy of the predictions obtained.
